# LocaleDB

A database of global locales to support modeling and simulation in epidemiology with the current focus on the COVID 19 pandemic.


## Abstract

Many models of COVID-19 have been proposed to date.  When compared against each other, it appears that many of these models make mutually incompatible predictions.  Such discrepancies between the output of competing models and simulations need explanation.  Inspecting the source code of those models in search for differences which might turn out to be the antecedents of the observed differences is a natural tendency.  Scrutinizing source code, however, especially when done automatically, is a valid approach only if model inputs are guaranteed to be identical.  For example, if two models use different subsets of the available disease dynamics data, they will likely yield different results even if the epidemiological and social (and other) mechanisms are modeled identically.  Moreover, even if the two models are indistinguishable in terms of how they model the various dynamics, comparing them will be hard if they are used to predict the trajectory of an epidemic in distinct locales (e.g., two different U.S. states or counties).  The LocaleDB initiative aims to unify, homogenize, and standardize various data sources that are inputs to models of the COVID-19 pandemic and thus provide data control for computational experiments of mass model comparison.


## Design

As shown on the figure below, LocaleDB stores several types of data (gray boxes indicate planned future extensions).  That data is stored in a PostgreSQL database which is managed by a command line tool ([`localedb`](localedb)) and a Python script ([`localedb_man.py`](localedb_man.py)).  The database can be accessed either via a PostgreSQL driver or a language-specific binding which provide a high level API to, for example, suggest U.S. counties similar to the county specified.  To that effect, we are currently working on [Python](https://github.com/momacs/localedb-py) bindings.

This design that separates data management and data consumption reflects the anticipated production use case.  Namely, the database will be deployed and set up once and will then require little to no manual management (periodic updates will be autonomous).  It will then be used for producing data that will drive modeling and simulation efforts.


## Data Types

As depicted on the figure above, the current projection is for LocaleDB to contain the following data types:

- **Disease dynamics** (e.g., number of confirmed cases)
- **Clinical** (e.g., hospital and ICU beds, R0, test results, vaccinations statistics, etc.)
- **Non-pharmaceutical interventions** (**NPIs**; e.g., dates of stay-at-home order)
- **Medical countermeasures** (**MCMs**; e.g., vaccine availability, efficacy, and allocation strategies)
- **Population** (e.g., households, their incomes, age of people, etc.)
- **Geographic and cartographic** (e.g., area of land, population density)
- **Health factors and outcomes** (e.g., diet, exercise, access to care, etc.)
- **Mobility** (e.g., number of trips taken by individuals based on mobile-phone data)
- **Air Traffic** (e.g., number of passengers landing in US cities; includes origin and destination)
- **Local events** (e.g., dates and sizes of mass protests)
- **Meteorological** (e.g., monthly temperature and precipitation)

All that data is stratified by locale at all available levels of spatial aggregation (e.g., country, state, county, tract, block group, block).  In terms of temporal resolution, the highest frequency with which processes are sampled/measured is the goal.  For example, disease dynamics is represented as a time series of daily numbers of confirmed cases and deaths, while health factors and outcomes are encoded with far fewer time steps.


### External Data Source Registration

The following data types require separate registration to obtain an API key.  That registration is only necessary if the corresponding data type is desired.

## Dependencies

### Development/Test Environment

- curl or wget
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)

### Production Environment

- curl or wget
- PostgreSQL client
- PostgreSQL server (with [PostGIS](https://github.com/postgis/postgis) and [TimescaleDB](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb) extensions)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org)

**Note**: Full production environment support will be added at a later date.


## Setup and Example Usage: Development/Test Environment

The development environment is based around Docker so you will need to get that installed first.  After sorting that out, clone the repo and change the working directory.  The cloned repo directory will be where all the data is stored so if you plan on loading a whole lot (looking at you, `geo` and `pop` data users), make sure you have enough space on that filesystem subtree.

```
git clone https://github.com/momacs/localedb
cd localedb
```

Then:

```
# Build the container:
./build-docker.sh

# Create volumes dir:
mkdir -p .localedb; for d in data log pg rt; do mkdir -p ./localedb/$d; done

# Start the container (takes about a minute for Postgres to become available):
docker-compose up -d

# Initialize the database inside the container:
docker-compose run --rm localedb setup
```

Displaying info and loading data is done using the following commands:

```
# Display info:
docker-compose run --rm localedb info all

# Load COVID-19 disease dynamics data:
docker-compose run --rm localedb load dis COVID-19

# Load Alaska COVID-19 clinical data (beds, tests, r0, etc.; run after the previous command):
docker-compose run --rm localedb load clinic AK <covid-actnow-api-key>

# Load Alaska geographic and cartographic data:
docker-compose run --rm localedb load geo AK

# Load synthetic population for Alaska:
docker-compose run --rm localedb load pop AK

# Load health data for Alaska:
docker-compose run --rm localedb load health AK

# Load weather data for years 2010 through 2020:
docker-compose run --rm localedb load weather 2010 2020

# Load vaccination data:
docker-compose run --rm localedb load vax

# Load mobility data for Alaska:
docker-compose run --rm localedb load mobility AK

# Load air traffic data for 2019 for flights traveling to Alaska (only flights with 25+ passengers):
docker-compose run --rm localedb load air-traffic 2019 AK 25
```

For the list of available commands, run either of the two:

```
docker-compose run --rm localedb
docker-compose run --rm localedb help
```

Keep in mind that some commands have subcommands.

Once not needed any more, the container can be stopped or taken down (i.e., stopped, removed, and all networks created removed):

```
docker-compose stop --timeout 300
docker-compose down --timeout 300
```

To remove the container with all associated volumes (watch out with this one because this includes the data you have loaded!), do:

```
docker-compose down -v --timeout 300
```

### Grafana

Running LocaleDB with Docker (i.e., the development environment) has the added benefit of automatically deploying a [Grafana](https://grafana.com) instance.  Grafana provides an open source data visualization and dashboarding platform to view and analyze LocaleDB.  By default, it runs at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) so head there once you get the Docker container up.

Currently, only the vaccination data dashboard is provided as an example.  Naturally, to be able to view any data on that dashboard, you'll need to load the data first:

```
docker-compose run --rm localedb load vax
```

To create a new dashboard, do so via the Grafana UI and export it as a `JSON` file.  Save this `JSON` file to `grafana/dashboards`.

### Development with Docker

Any changes to the docker image require `./build-docker.sh` to be run to update the image.  `localedb` and `localedb_man.py` are mounted as volumes, so any changes to the management and loading routines will take effect immediately.


## Setup and Example Usage: Production Environment

Production environment (which is based on a local PostgreSQL server) isn't supported yet.  Please use Dockerized deployment discussed above for now.

### Command Line Management Tool

On MacOS run:

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/momacs/localedb/master/setup.sh -O -)"
```

On Linux run:
```
sh -c "$(wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/momacs/localedb/master/setup.sh -O -)"
```

Alternatively, you can run the commands from the [`setup.sh`](setup.sh) script manually.

**Production environment:** For production deployment, after the installation script above has finished, edit the `$HOME/bin/localedb` script and change `is_prod=0` to `is_prod=1`.  This step is left to be done manually to ensure intent.

### CLI

After setting up the command line management tool, setup the LocaleDB instance:

```
$ localedb setup
Initializing data structures... done
Loading locales... done
```

To display filesystem information, run:

```
$ localedb info fs
Directory structure
    Root               /Users/tomek/.localedb         43M
    Data: Disease      /Users/tomek/.localedb/dl/dis  0B
    Data: Geographic   /Users/tomek/.localedb/dl/geo  0B
    Data: Population   /Users/tomek/.localedb/dl/pop  0B
    Log                /Users/tomek/.localedb/log     0B
    PostgreSQL data    /Users/tomek/.localedb/pg      43M
    Runtime            /Users/tomek/.localedb/rt      0B
```

To import COVID-19 disease data (currently only dynamics and non-pharmaceutical interventions), run:

```
$ localedb load dis COVID-19
Disease dynamics
    Loading global confirmed... done (11 s)
    Loading global deaths... done (14 s)
    Loading global recovered... done (12 s)

    Loading Keystone... done (14 s)
```

```
$ localedb load clinic AK <covid-actnow-api-key>
Downloading... done (19 s)
Processing... done (100 s; n=12321)
```

To import geographic and cartographic data for the state of Alaska, run:

```
$ localedb load geo AK
US states        done
US counties      done
AK tracts        done
AK block groups  done
AK blocks        done
Analyzing database... done
```

To import health data for the state of Alaska, run:

```
$ localedb load health AK
```

To import weather data from 2010 to 2020, run:

```
$ localedb load weather 2010 2020
```

To import mobility data for Alaska run:

```
$ localedb load mobility AK
```

To import air traffic data for 2019 for flights traveling to Alaska which had more than 25 passengers run:

```
$ localedb load air-traffic 2019 AK 25
```

To import synthetic population data, run:

```
$ localedb load pop AK
AK  done
Analyzing database... done
```

Imported states can be removed like so:

```
localedb db rm state-geo AK
localedb db rm state-pop AK

localedb db rm state AK  # remove all data types
```

Once data has been imported and the downloaded data files are no longer needed, they can be removed like so:

```
localedb fs rm-data geo
localedb db rm-data pop

localedb db rm data-all  # remove all data files
```

To stop LocaleDB instance, run:

```
localedb stop
```

To uninstall LocaleDB (leaving nothing behind), run:

```
localedb uninstall
```

For the list of available commands, run `localedb`.  For an explanation of each command, run `localedb help`.  Keep in mind that some commands have subcommands.
